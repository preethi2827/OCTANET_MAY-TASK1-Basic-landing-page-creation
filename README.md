# OctaNet Services Pvt Ltd Internship: Basic Landing Page Creation

Welcome to my repository for Task 1 of the OctaNet Services Pvt Ltd web development internship! ðŸš€

## Overview

In this project, I have created a basic landing page aimed at providing free courses for students. The landing page includes essential features such as:

- Home
- About
- Courses Details
- Contact Us
- Course Sites

Additionally, at the bottom of the landing page, I have added icons linking to my LinkedIn, GitHub, and Instagram profiles to facilitate networking and connections within the tech community.

## Technologies Used

The landing page was created entirely using Visual Studio Code, with the following structure:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the landing page.
- `assets/css/`: This directory holds all the CSS files used for styling the landing page, including:
  - `styles.css`: Contains the main styles for the page layout.
  - `animation.css`: Includes any animations or transitions applied to elements.
  - `util.css`: Houses utility classes for quick styling adjustments.

Furthermore, the `assets/images/` directory stores all image assets utilized in the landing page design.
